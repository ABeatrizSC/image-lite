https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13879340-90ef-4022-acb0-30c7cd1772ff


## About  
This project functions as an image repository developed with Spring Boot, ReactJS, and NextJS, allowing users to create accounts, upload JPEG, PNG, and GIF images, view and download them.  

## Project Structure  
- `imagelite`: This folder contains the front-end code of the application, built with TypeScript, ReactJS, and NextJS.  
- `imageliteapi`: Stores the back-end code for the REST API developed using Java and Spring Boot.  

## Features  
- User creation  
- View uploaded images  
- Add new images  
- Download images  

## Technologies Used  

* **Java**: A high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for building server-side applications, web services, and Android applications.

* **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making code easier to read, debug, and maintain.

* **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing built-in features for dependency injection, configuration, and microservices support.

* **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on creating reusable UI components and managing the view layer in web applications.

* **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimized web applications, along with built-in routing and API handling.

* **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its robustness, extensibility, and advanced features such as JSON support and full ACID compliance.

* **Docker**: A platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight containers, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying the setup process.

* **Spring Security**: A powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications.

* **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In this application, JWT is used for securely transmitting information about the userâ€™s identity and for maintaining stateless authentication in a microservices architecture.

* **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build modern, responsive designs by composing utility classes directly in the HTML.

* **Lombok**: A Java library that reduces boilerplate code by generating common methods like getters, setters, constructors, and more through annotations.

* **MapStruct**: A code generator that simplifies the mapping of Java bean properties, making it easier to convert between different object models and reducing the amount of manual mapping code required.

* **JPA**: The Java Persistence API, a specification that provides object-relational mapping (ORM) to manage relational data in Java applications.

* **Formik**: A library for building and managing forms in React, providing features like validation, state management, and submission handling.

* **JWT-Decode**: A small library for decoding JSON Web Tokens, allowing easy extraction of information from the token payload.

* **React-Toastify**: A React library for displaying customizable toast notifications in a simple and consistent manner.

* **Yup**: A JavaScript schema validation library, commonly used with Formik to define validation schemas for forms.

* **Postman**: A tool used for API testing and development, enabling users to send HTTP requests, inspect responses, and automate API tests.
